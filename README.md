# Programming Fundamental

As a newbie in Computer Science, this repository is my grand experiment in learning the ABCs of different programming languages 😼. Think of it as my public diary of triumphs, face-palms, and the epic battles between me and a missing semicolon. Come for the code, stay for the chaotic energy of a beginner on a mission! 🙂‍↕️


## Lessons Learned

I'm currently on a mission to learn the ways of three distinct coding tribes. So far, I've learned Python, Javascript, and C++. The biggest challenge is the constant context-switching. If you find a rogue semicolon in my Python code, you know who to blame! 🫠
## So, Cheers Up!
