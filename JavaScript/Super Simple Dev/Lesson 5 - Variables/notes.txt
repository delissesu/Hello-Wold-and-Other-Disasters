- Variable is like a container, can contain a value

- How variable work:
1. Create a variable name:
- Cant use special words, example: let
- Cant start with a number, example; 2number
- Cant use special character like symbol, example: ^saa

- Semicolon is mark to end of code or instruction

- Naming convention:
1. camelCase, myName
2. snake_case, my_name
3. PascalCase, like MyName
4. kebab-case, my-name (dont work in js, cz detected like negative operation), just for html and css

- Best practice to use const by default and use let when i need to change the variable
