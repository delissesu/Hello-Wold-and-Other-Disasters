This note is about more details about math and number in Javascript:

In programming:
2, 3, 4 = integers
2.2, 2.5 = floating point numbers (floats)
But computer have a problem while working with floats.

While calculating using float, sometimes the result maybe can be inaccurate. Because computer only can store 0 and 1. This problem is not only in Javascript, but in many different programming language have the same problem too.

Computer can store (=> 0, 1) 0 and 1, but human can count number from 0 >= number >= 9 (0, 1, 2, ..., 9). In this case, seem like have a problem in number system.

For integers, that is not a problem, but with float or decimal numbers, the computer cannot store binary number properly. The inaccuraccies have problem in some floating number, in this case cannot reach the float number properly.

While calculating money, we must avoid the innacurate calculation.
How to avoid the problem in best practice when calculating money is calculate in cents instead of dollars.

So, because calculation with floats are sometimes inaccurate, when working with money:
1. Do the calculation in cents
2. Convert back to dollars
