// For this task, same like 3k, but different information and math calculation
// I know the shipping for shirt and basketball is 4.99

// Basketball price and how many ball
// let basketball_price = 2095
// let basketball = 2
// const basketball_final_price = basketball * basketball_price

// Shirt price and shirt piece
// let shirt_price = 799
// let shirt = 2
// const shirt_final_price = shirt * shirt_price

// Shipping order
let shipping = 499
let shipping_for_final_order = shipping * 2

console.log(`Shipping & handling: $${shipping_for_final_order / 100}`)
